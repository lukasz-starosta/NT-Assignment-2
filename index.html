        <h2>Ethernet frame</h2>
        <p>
            In computer networking, an Ethernet frame is a data link layer protocol data unit that uses the underlying
            Ethernet physical layer transport mechanisms.
            In other words, a data unit on an Ethernet link transports an Ethernet frame as its payload.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Preamble</h4>
                <p>
                    An Ethernet packet starts with a seven-octet preamble and one-octet start frame delimiter (SFD).
                    The preamble consists of a 56-bit (seven-byte) pattern of alternating 1 and 0 bits, allowing
                    devices on the network to easily synchronize their receiver clocks, providing bit-level
                    synchronization.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>SFD</h4>
                <p>
                    It provides byte-level synchronization and to mark a new incoming frame.The SFD is the eight-bit
                    (one-byte) value that marks the end of the preamble, which is the first field of an Ethernet
                    packet, and indicates the beginning of the Ethernet frame.
                    The SFD is designed to break the bit pattern of the preamble and signal the start of the actual
                    frame.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Adresses</h4>
                <p>
                    Consist of 6 bytes. Frame is received by all adapters on a LAN and dropped if address does not
                    match.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Ether</h4>
                <p>
                    It is two octets long and it can be used for two different purposes. Values of 1500 and below mean
                    that it is used to indicate the size of the payload in octets, while values of 1536 and above
                    indicate that it is used as an EtherType, to indicate which protocol is encapsulated in the payload
                    of the frame.
                    When used as EtherType, the length of the frame is determined by the location of the interpacket
                    gap and valid frame check sequence (FCS).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Payload</h4>
                <p>
                    The minimum payload is 42 octets when an 802.1Q tag is present and 46 octets when absent. When the
                    actual payload is less, padding bytes are added accordingly.
                    The maximum payload is 1500 octets. Non-standard jumbo frames allow for larger maximum payload
                    size.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Frame Check Sequence</h4>
                <p>
                    The frame check sequence (FCS) is a four-octet cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that allows detection
                    of corrupted data within the entire frame as received on the receiver side.
                    The FCS value is computed as a function of the protected MAC frame fields: source and destination
                    address, length/type field, MAC client data and padding (that is, all fields except the FCS).
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>MAC address and broadcasting</h2>
        <p>
            A media access control address (MAC address) of a device is a unique identifier assigned to a network
            interface controller (NIC) for communications at the data link layer of a network segment.
            MAC addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet and
            Wi-Fi. In this context, MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Broadcasting refers to sending traffic to all nodes on a network. Layer 2 broadcast traffic stays within a
            local area network (LAN) boundary; known as the broadcast domain.
        </p>
        <h2>Router, switch and hub</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Router</h4>
                <p>
                    The router forwards data packets along networks. It is connected to at least two networks, commonly
                    two LANs or WANs or a LAN and its ISP's network. Routers are located at gateways, the places where
                    two or more networks connect.
                    Routers use headers and forwarding tables to determine the best path for forwarding the packets,
                    and they use protocols to communicate with each other and configure the best route between any two
                    hosts.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Switch</h4>
                <p>
                    In networks the switch is the device that filters and forwards packets between LAN segments.
                    Switches operate at the data link layer (layer 2) and sometimes the network layer (layer 3) of the
                    OSI Reference Model and therefore support any packet protocol.
                    LANs that use switches to join segments are called switched LANs or, in the case of Ethernet
                    networks, switched Ethernet LANs.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Hub</h4>
                <p>
                    A hub is a common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs connect segments of a LAN.
                    It contains multiple ports so when a packet arrives at one port, it is copied to the other ports so
                    that all segments of the LAN can see all packets.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Differences</h3>
        <p>
            In a hub, a frame is passed along or "broadcast" to every one of its ports. It doesn't matter that the
            frame is only destined for one port. The hub has no way of distinguishing which port a frame should be sent
            to. Passing it along to every port ensures that it will reach its intended destination. This places a lot
            of traffic on the network and can lead to poor network response times.
        </p>
        <p>
            A switch, however, keeps a record of the MAC addresses of all the devices connected to it. With this
            information, a switch can identify which system is sitting on which port. So when a frame is received, it
            knows exactly which port to send it to, without significantly increasing network response times. And,
            unlike a hub, a 10/100Mbps switch will allocate a full 10/100Mbps to each of its ports.
            So regardless of the number of PCs transmitting, users will always have access to the maximum amount of
            bandwidth. It's for these reasons a switch is considered to be a much better choice than a hub.
        </p>
        <p>
            Routers are completely different devices. Where a hub or switch is concerned with transmitting frames, a
            router's job, as its name implies, is to route packets to other networks until that packet ultimately
            reaches its destination. One of the key features of a packet is that it not only contains data, but the
            destination address of where it's going.
        </p>
        <h2>CSMA/CD</h2>
        <p>
            CSMA/CD (carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection) is a media access control method used most
            notably in early Ethernet technology for local area networking. It uses carrier-sensing to defer
            transmissions until no other stations are transmitting.
            This is used in combination with collision detection in which a transmitting station detects collisions by
            sensing transmissions from other stations while it is transmitting a frame. When this collision condition
            is detected, the station stops transmitting that frame, transmits a jam signal, and then waits for a random
            time interval before trying to resend the frame.
        </p>
        <h3>Collision</h3>
        <p>
            In a half duplex Ethernet network, a collision is the result of two devices on the same Ethernet network
            attempting to transmit data at exactly the same time.
            The network detects the "collision" of the two transmitted packets and discards them both. Collisions are a
            natural occurrence on Ethernets.
        </p>
        <h3>Half duplex</h3>
        <p>
            In a half-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other, but not simultaneously; the
            communication is one direction at a time. An example of a half-duplex device is a walkie-talkie two-way
            radio that has a "push-to-talk" button; when the local user wants to speak to the remote person they push
            this button, which turns on the transmitter but turns off the receiver, so they cannot hear the remote
            person.
            To listen to the other person they release the button, which turns on the receiver but turns off the
            transmitter.
        </p>
        <h3>Full duplex</h3>
        <p>
            In a full-duplex system, both parties can communicate with each other simultaneously. An example of a
            full-duplex device is a telephone; the parties at both ends of a call can speak and be heard by the other
            party simultaneously.
            The earphone reproduces the speech of the remote party as the microphone transmits the speech of the local
            party, because there is a two-way communication channel between them, or more strictly speaking, because
            there are two communication channels between them.
        </p>
        <h2>ARP Request</h2>
        <p>
            The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer
            address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
            This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite.
        </p>
        <p>
            ARP request - enquire for physical adress of host. ARP sends request to all hosts belonging to the same
            network. Request contains logcial adress of target host and physical adress of host sending this request.
            The answer is only sent by target host and it has both logical and physical adress of it. Sender saves this
            information in so-called ARP table and links logical address of target host with its physical adress.
        </p>
        <p>
            Detecting doubled ip adresse - when two hosts on the same link attempt to use the same IPv4 address at the
            same time (except in rare special cases where this has been arranged by prior coordination), problems ensue
            for one or both hosts.
            ARP provides an easy way for a host to detect this kind of misconfiguration and report it to the user.

        <h2>BOOTP</h2>
        <p>
            The Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a computer networking protocol used in Internet Protocol networks to
            automatically assign an IP address to network devices from a configuration server.
            The BOOTP was originally defined in RFC 951.
        </p>
        <h2>DHCP</h2>
        <p>
            The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on UDP/IP networks
            whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each
            device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.
            A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the
            Internet service provider (ISP), reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign
            IP addresses to all network devices. In the absence of a DHCP server, a computer or other device on the
            network needs to be manually assigned an IP address, or to assign itself an APIPA address, which will not
            enable it to communicate outside its local subnet.
        </p>
        <h2>VLANs</h2>
        <p>
            A virtual LAN (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the
            data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this context virtual
            refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic. VLANs work by applying tags to
            network packets and handling these tags in networking systems – creating the appearance and functionality
            of network traffic that is physically on a single network but acts as if it is split between separate
            networks.
            In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical
            network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed.
        </p>
        <p>
            VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts together even if the hosts are not directly connected to
            the same network switch. Because VLAN membership can be configured through software, this can greatly
            simplify network design and deployment. Without VLANs, grouping hosts according to their resource needs
            necessitates the labor of relocating nodes or rewiring data links.
            VLANs allow networks and devices that must be kept separate to share the same physical cabling without
            interacting, improving simplicity, security, traffic management, or economy.
